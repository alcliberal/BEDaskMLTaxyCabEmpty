# Dask on Kubernetes

In this class, we focus on getting a [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/) cluster running in Kubernetes, which we will then use in the [Dask project](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/OBD/2_6_project.html). Dask is a parallel computing library in Python which integrates well with machine learning tools like scikit-learn.

Students will use GCP for this class. Be sure to stop your cluster after class to conserve GCP credits.

Additional resources can be found in the [dask documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/setup/kubernetes.html).

This class builds on the
[orchestration](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/OBD/1_4_orchestration.html)
class given in the fall, going into further detail on K8S specifics.
